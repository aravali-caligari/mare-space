<p>Getting Started Welcome to WindsMARE! Here are some basic commands that will help you get started on your journies as an Adventurer:</p>
<a name="general information"></a>
<p><b>general information</b></p>
<p>General Information WindsMARE, which stands for Multi-User Adventure Role-Playing Epic, is a virtual reality text-based fantasy game combining the survival and exploration objectives of the real world into a theme of medieval proportions, where high priests, lords, wizards and arch-magi, master thieves, dragons, fierce demons, and even the gods themselves may come into play. There are 5 types of objects: Players , Rooms , Zones , Exits , and Things , each which make up their own part of the virtual database. Rooms are the backbone of the world, for every object in some way must be inside a room.</p>

<a name="reconnect"></a>
<p><b>reconnect</b></p>
<p>RECONNECT Similar to QUIT , the Reconnect command disconnects your character from the game and immediately returns you to the login prompt, where you may once again connect to your character or select a new one to login to.</p>

<p>@Commands</p>
<a name="@addparent"></a>
<p><b>@addparent</b></p>
<p>@addparent &lt;object&gt;=&lt;parent&gt; This command gives an object a new parent. Objects may have any number of parents related to them. The parent object must be either controlled by you or have the Bearing flag set.</p>
<a name="@addrelay"></a>
<p><b>@addrelay</b></p>
<p>@addrelay &lt;object1&gt;=&lt;object2&gt; This command adds object2 to the list of relays on object1. An object, with a relay set, will send all that it hears to object2, in the form that corresponds to the @rhear attribute. This works much like how a puppet sends what it hears to its owner.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@listen #2000=*</font>
<li><font color="#008000">@rhear #2000=From afar, [v(0)]</font>
<li><font color="#008000">@addrelay #2000=#195</font>
</ul>
<a name="@addzone"></a>
<p><b>@addzone</b></p>
<p>@addzone &lt;room&gt;=&lt;zone object&gt; This command adds a zone object to a particular room. A zone object must be an object that was previously created with the @zone command. Once a room is zoned, exits from within may not be linked to other rooms outside of the zone.</p>
<a name="@chown"></a>
<p><b>@chown</b></p>
<p>@chown &lt;object&gt; @chown &lt;object&gt;=&lt;player&gt; This command changes ownership of a particular object, room, or exit. To @chown things, you must be carrying them. For rooms or exits, you must be in the room that they are in.</p>
<a name="@clone"></a>
<p><b>@clone</b></p>
<p>@clone &lt;object&gt; @clone &lt;object&gt;=&lt;newname&gt; This command makes an exact duplicate of the specified object, and puts it in your inventory. If &lt;newname&gt; is specified, the object created will be named as such. You must be able to control the object to clone it.</p>
<a name="@create"></a>
<p><b>@create</b></p>
<p>@create &lt;object name&gt; This command creates an object with the specified name, and puts it in your inventory. Creation costs a subtle amount of Gold Pieces .</p>
<a name="@cycle"></a>
<p><b>@cycle</b></p>
<p>@cycle &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attr&gt;=arg1,arg2,..,arg100 This command cycles the contents of a particular attribute on &lt;object&gt; with the next argument in the series. If the last argument is reached, the @cycle command will switch it back to the first, and so on. Example: @cycle me/vz=Bill,Mary,Jane</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@cycle me/vz=Bill,Mary,Jane</font>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Vz: Bill</font></ul>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Vz: Mary</font></ul>
<a name="@decompile"></a>
<p><b>@decompile</b></p>
<p>@decompile &lt;object&gt; This command outputs a series of instructions, in regular text, that may be quoted or typed back into TinyMARE to reproduce the object in its entirity. This command is useful for copying objects between multi-user realms or recording the data of an object for personal use offline, most likely as backup or for local editing. This command does nothing to the object itself, only merely displays its contents in command form.</p>
<a name="@defattr"></a>
<p><b>@defattr</b></p>
<p>@def @defattr &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attr&gt; @defattr &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attr&gt;=&lt;options&gt; @defattr &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute pattern&gt;=&lt;options&gt; This command creates a new attribute, with name &lt;attr&gt;, on a particular object. The attribute can be set to a value using the @set command, or by using the abbreviation @&lt;attr&gt; &lt;object&gt;=&lt;value&gt; . Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@def me/quest=inherit osee</font>
<li><font color="#008000">@quest me=To seek the Holy Grail.</font>
</ul>
<a name="@delparent"></a>
<p><b>@delparent</b></p>
<p>@delparent &lt;object&gt;=&lt;parent&gt; This command removes a parent from the object. You must be able to own the object's parent, or the parent must already have the Bearing flag set.</p>
<a name="@delrelay"></a>
<p><b>@delrelay</b></p>
<p>@delrelay &lt;object&gt;=&lt;object2&gt; This command removes object2 from the list of relays on object1. It may be appropriate to also remove the @rhear attribute on the object, if no relays are present.</p>
<a name="@delzone"></a>
<p><b>@delzone</b></p>
<p>@delzone &lt;room&gt;=&lt;zone object&gt; This command removes a zone object from the list of zones on a room. You must be able to own both the zone object and the specified room.</p>
<a name="@destroy"></a>
<p><b>@destroy</b></p>
<p>@destroy &lt;object&gt; @destroy &lt;object&gt;=Now @destroy &lt;object&gt;=&lt;seconds&gt; This command destroys a thing, room, or exit currently in the player's possession. All rooms that are destroyed will be automatically set with the Going flag, and the room itself will be destroyed nearly 10 minutes after the command is issued. During that time, you may type @undestroy to stop the process.</p>
<a name="@dig"></a>
<p><b>@dig</b></p>
<p>@dig &lt;room&gt; @dig &lt;room&gt;=&lt;exit to&gt;,&lt;exit back&gt; This command creates a new room with the specified name, and displays its number. If you include additional exit names, they will be opened up from the room you are in (and back again, if you include the &lt;exit back&gt;). You cannot open any exits out of a room that you do not own.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@dig Green Giant Tavern</font>
<li><font color="#008000">@dig Secret Vault=Vault,Out</font>
<li><font color="#008000">@dig Dragon's Nest=Nest &lt;U&gt;;nest;up;u,Down &lt;D&gt;;down;d</font>
</ul>
<a name="@echo"></a>
<p><b>@echo</b></p>
<p>@echo &lt;message&gt; This command parses and sends a message to the player who executes it, namely yourself. It is mostly useful for objects, or for parsing function values. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@echo You need %E more experience points for level [add(v(level),1)].</font>
</ul>
<a name="@edit"></a>
<p><b>@edit</b></p>
<p>@edit &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attr&gt;=$,&lt;string to append&gt; @edit &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attr&gt;=^,&lt;string to prepend&gt; @edit &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attr&gt;=&lt;old string&gt;,&lt;new string&gt; This command edits a particular &lt;attr&gt; of an object, replacing all occurances of &lt;old string&gt; with &lt;new string&gt;. If ^ or $ is used, the string will be prepended or appended, respectively. If the string contains complex characters such as non-alphabetic or numeral characters, curly braces are required around the string.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@edit me/vz=abc,{a,b,c}</font>
</ul>
<a name="@emit"></a>
<p><b>@emit</b></p>
<p>@emit &lt;message&gt; This command parses and sends a message to all of the players who are in the current room that you are in. You cannot spoof, however, or begin the message with the name of another player, and pretend to be that other person.</p>
<a name="@find"></a>
<p><b>@find</b></p>
<p>@find @find &lt;pattern&gt; This command searches the database and lists all of the objects that you own, whose names match &lt;pattern&gt;. If no arguments are presented, this command will list all rooms and things that you own. Finding objects requires a subtle fee.</p>
<a name="@force"></a>
<p><b>@force</b></p>
<p>@fo @force &lt;object&gt;=&lt;commands&gt; This command forces a particular object to execute a set of &lt;commands&gt;. The list of commands is in the same format as action attributes, in that they are each separated by a semicolon. Only wizards are able to force other players to do things.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@force puppet=say Hi there!;pose smiles.</font>
</ul>
<a name="@foreach"></a>
<p><b>@foreach</b></p>
<p>@foreach &lt;wordlist&gt;=&lt;actions&gt; This command executes &lt;actions&gt; (which may be a semicolon-separated list of commands) for each word in &lt;wordlist&gt;, whose elements are separated by spaces. If a %0 or [v(0)] occurs anywhere in the command, it will be substituted by the current word from the wordlist, in order, while iterating. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@foreach n u p e r=say gimmie a %0!</font>
<li><font color="#008000">@foreach Hplimit Mplimit Enlimit="My %0 is [v(v(0))].</font>
</ul>
<a name="@halt"></a>
<p><b>@halt</b></p>
<p>@halt @halt &lt;object&gt; @halt &lt;object&gt;=&lt;commands&gt; This command halts all of the objects owned by you. Any command currently in the queue for an object will be removed, and all will be silent. If you specify an object as the target, only that object will be halted.</p>
<a name="@iterate"></a>
<p><b>@iterate</b></p>
<p>@iterate &lt;pattern&gt;=&lt;command&gt;,&lt;action&gt; Invokes the command &lt;action&gt; for every output line of &lt;command&gt; that matches &lt;pattern&gt;. Unmatching parts of the output get discarded. Since &lt;action&gt; is placed into the command queue and executed only after the full output of &lt;command&gt; is done, the Quiet flag need not be set to protect against infinite recursion.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@iterate *(#*)*=@search type=player,@pennies #%1=390</font>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Instantly sets everyone's money amount to 390.</font></ul>
<a name="@link"></a>
<p><b>@link</b></p>
<p>@link &lt;exit&gt;=&lt;destination&gt; This command links an exit, to a destination room. The destination is usually specified as a database reference number, such as #12345. You may link an exit to any room you own, or to any room set with the Link_Ok flag.</p>
<a name="@list"></a>
<p><b>@list</b></p>
<p>@list @list &lt;category&gt; @list &lt;category&gt;=&lt;value&gt; This command lists various tables of data, configured in the source code of netmare. Typing @list on a line by itself without arguments shows you the possible categories that can be obtained. Type @list &lt;category&gt; to get a full readout of that particular category.</p>
<a name="@memory"></a>
<p><b>@memory</b></p>
<p>@memory @memory &lt;player&gt; This command shows the complete memory usage of you, or another person online. It also tells you the percentage of objects and bytes used out of the total of the entire game, combining all of the players and objects in the database.</p>
<a name="@misc"></a>
<p><b>@misc</b></p>
<p>@misc Used for artificial intelligence robots that correspond to multi-user realms such as TinyMush and TinyMuse, this command displays the original error message used by those programs. Since most maas-neotek robots use @misc as their way of checking to see if the local mud is still alive, it is appropriate to have this command available in TinyMare.</p>
<a name="@name"></a>
<p><b>@name</b></p>
<p>@name &lt;object&gt;=&lt;newname&gt; This command changes the name of an object, room, or exit, to a new name. You must be able to control the object to change its name. Only wizards are able to change the names of players online.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@name road=Pathway &lt;N&gt;;path;north;n</font>
</ul>
<a name="@necho"></a>
<p><b>@necho</b></p>
<p>@necho &lt;message&gt; This command sends a message to the player who executes it, namely yourself. Unlike @echo , no spaces are removed from the message text, and no functions are parsed.</p>
<a name="@nemit"></a>
<p><b>@nemit</b></p>
<p>@nemit &lt;message&gt; This command sends a message to all of the players who are in the current room that you are in. You cannot spoof, however, or begin the message with the name of another player, and pretend to be that other person.</p>
<a name="@npemit"></a>
<p><b>@npemit</b></p>
<p>@npemit &lt;object&gt;=&lt;message&gt; This command emits a message to one object or player only. You cannot begin the message with the name of another player, and pretend to be that other person.</p>
<a name="@oemit"></a>
<p><b>@oemit</b></p>
<p>@oemit &lt;object&gt;=&lt;message&gt; This command parses and emits a message to everybody in the room you are in, except for the specified &lt;object&gt;. You cannot begin the message with the name of another player, and pretend to be that other person.</p>
<a name="@open"></a>
<p><b>@open</b></p>
<p>@open &lt;exit&gt; @open &lt;exit&gt;=&lt;destination&gt; This command opens an exit, from the current room you are in, to a destination room (if specified). You must own the current room to create an exit, and the destination room must be either controlled by you or set with the Link_Ok flag. Opening exits costs a small fee, and linking them costs an additional fee.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@dig Crystal Lake</font>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Crystal Lake created with room number 2744.</font></ul>
<a name="@oremit"></a>
<p><b>@oremit</b></p>
<p>@oremit &lt;object&gt;=&lt;message&gt; This command parses and emits a message to everybody in the room that &lt;object&gt; is in, except for the specified &lt;object&gt; itself. Unlike @oemit , this command may be used to send a message to an entirely different room than the one you are in.</p>
<a name="@passwd"></a>
<p><b>@passwd</b></p>
<p>@passwd @passwd &lt;playername&gt; This command allows you to change the password of your character. You will be prompted to enter in your old password with local echo turned off, so that others in the room will not easily see what you are typing. The @passwd command may only be used in direct mode and not executed by using a command in the Queue .</p>
<a name="@pemit"></a>
<p><b>@pemit</b></p>
<p>@pemit &lt;object&gt;=&lt;message&gt; This command parses and emits a message to one object or player only. You cannot begin the message with the name of another player, and pretend to be that other person.</p>
<a name="@poll"></a>
<p><b>@poll</b></p>
<p>@poll @poll &lt;message&gt; This command sets the Quote of the Day, seen by using the who command, with the poll who-flag in use. Once the quote has been set, it cannot be changed for another 15 minutes.</p>
<a name="@ps"></a>
<p><b>@ps</b></p>
<p>@ps @ps &lt;category&gt; @ps &lt;category&gt;=&lt;player&gt; This command lists all of the elements in each queue scheduled to take place in the next slice of time. Typing @ps without arguments will list all of the commands currently waiting to be executed by the use of the @force , @trigger , and @wait commands, for all objects either owned or controlled by you. Each command executed in the queue costs a minute fraction of a Gold Piece , preventing troublesome users from creating infinite loops through the use of @trigger s or action attributes.</p>
<a name="@push"></a>
<p><b>@push</b></p>
<p>@push &lt;object&gt; This command pushes an object or exit up to the top of the contents list or exits list in a particular room. You must own the object's location to be able to move the item around in the stack.</p>
<a name="@redefattr"></a>
<p><b>@redefattr</b></p>
<p>@redef @redefattr &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attr&gt;=&lt;newname&gt; This command renames the attribute &lt;attr&gt;, on &lt;object&gt;, to &lt;newname&gt;. All of the object's children, if any, with this attribute set will have it renamed. An attribute name may not shadow, or be equal to, a built-in attribute that is already in the game itself, such as @desc or @succ .</p>
<a name="@redirect"></a>
<p><b>@redirect</b></p>
<p>@redir @redirect &lt;object&gt;=&lt;commands&gt; This command redirects the output of a particular command to &lt;object&gt;. It is similar to @force , except that the commands specified will be executed immediately.</p>
<a name="@remit"></a>
<p><b>@remit</b></p>
<p>@remit &lt;room&gt;=&lt;message&gt; This command parses and emits a message to all of the objects located in the specified room. You cannot spoof, however, or begin the message with the name of another player, and pretend to be that other person.</p>
<a name="@search"></a>
<p><b>@search</b></p>
<p>@search @search &lt;player&gt; @search &lt;category&gt;=&lt;type&gt; @search &lt;player&gt; &lt;category&gt;=&lt;type&gt; This command searches through the database, and lists all players, things, rooms, and exits for which &lt;type&gt; matches on the object under the specified &lt;category&gt;. If no arguments are given to the command, it will display all of the objects you own or control, including exits (unlike @find ). All things are listed along with their location.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@search type=room</font>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Lists all rooms that you own.</font></ul>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Lists objects you own whose description
 contains the word 'table'.</font></ul>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Lists objects you own whose name matches
 the word 'wind', including things like 'windmill' and 'window'.</font></ul>
<a name="@set"></a>
<p><b>@set</b></p>
<p>@set &lt;object&gt;=&lt;flags&gt; @set &lt;object&gt;=&lt;attribute&gt;:&lt;value&gt; @&lt;attribute&gt; &lt;object&gt;=&lt;value&gt; The @set command may be used to assign values to attributes, or to mark certain flags on various objects. To set a flag on an object that you own or control, type @set &lt;object&gt;=&lt;flag&gt; . To remove a flag from an object, type @set &lt;object&gt;=!&lt;flag&gt; .</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@set here=!abode link_ok jump_ok</font>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Removes the Abode flag on the current room
and sets the Link_Ok and Jump_Ok flags.</font></ul>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Sets the description attribute on the table.</font></ul>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Same as above, but instead using the shortcut method.</font></ul>
<a name="@stats"></a>
<p><b>@stats</b></p>
<p>@stats @stats me @stats &lt;player&gt; This command views the current database statistics of the game, showing the total number of objects both online and active, and the total number of rooms, things, exits, and players that comprise the total amount of objects. Also listed are the number of players in each administrative class rank. You may also view the complete stats of only the objects that you own, and if you are a wizard, you may view the database stats of any other player as well.</p>
<a name="@switch"></a>
<p><b>@switch</b></p>
<p>@swi @switch &lt;expression&gt;=&lt;result1&gt;,&lt;commands1&gt;,..,&lt;default commands&gt; This command tests an expression with a series of specified values, and places an action into the command queue corresponding to the appropriate value. First, it evaluates &lt;expression&gt;, and tests it with &lt;result1&gt;. Examples: @switch sub(6,4)=3,{&quot;Correct.},{&quot;Wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@switch 2=1,{"one},2,{"two},3,{"three}</font>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">You say, "two"</font></ul>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">You say, "Wrong. Try again."</font></ul>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">You say, "Begins with y."</font></ul>
<a name="@text"></a>
<p><b>@text</b></p>
<p>@text @text &lt;filename&gt; @text &lt;filename&gt;=,,&lt;object&gt; @text &lt;filename&gt;=&lt;top line#&gt;,&lt;bottom line#&gt; @text &lt;filename&gt;=&lt;top line#&gt;,&lt;bottom line#&gt;,&lt;object&gt; This command outputs a local file, from the game's main directory listing of files, to yourself, or a different player if &lt;object&gt; is specified. Typing @text by itself will give you a directory listing of all available files that this command can work with. You may type @text &lt;directory&gt; , without the slash, to receive a listing of that directory as well.</p>
<a name="@time"></a>
<p><b>@time</b></p>
<p>@time &lt;commands&gt; This command times the execution of a particular group of commands, separated by semicolons. After the commands are executed, you will receive a display of how long the command took to process completely. In all respect, this command is equivalent to @force me=&lt;commands&gt; , but with an added time counter.</p>
<a name="@trigger"></a>
<p><b>@trigger</b></p>
<p>@tr @trigger &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attr&gt;=%0,%1,..,%9 This command triggers a particular attribute, filled with a list of commands separated by semicolons, on an object. The object will execute the commands, if possible, substituting %0 through %9 with the various arguments that are placed into the @trigger command itself. Examples: @va menu=@pemit %#=Okay, you will get %1 with %0 for %2. @trigger menu/va=Fries,Fish,$1.90</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@va me=@echo Renting price for %0 days is $[mul(v(0),v(1))].</font>
<li><font color="#008000">@trigger me/va=6,50</font>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Renting price for 6 days is $300.</font></ul>
<ul><li><font color="#004000">Okay, you will get Fish with Fries for $1.90.</font></ul>
<a name="@undefattr"></a>
<p><b>@undefattr</b></p>
<p>@undef @undefattr &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attr&gt; This command permanently removes a previously created user-defined attribute on an object. All values set on this attribute, whether it is the object itself or any children with the object as its parent, will be lost. Built-in attributes, such as @desc or @succ , may not be removed from the game.</p>
<a name="@undestroy"></a>
<p><b>@undestroy</b></p>
<p>@undestroy &lt;object&gt; This command saves an object, particularly a room, from destruction. Its Going flag will be removed, and its destruction counter will be cleared.</p>
<a name="@unlink"></a>
<p><b>@unlink</b></p>
<p>@unlink &lt;exit&gt; This command unlinks an exit from its destination room. Nobody will be able to use the exit until it is further linked, by the owner, to a new location.</p>
<a name="@unlock"></a>
<p><b>@unlock</b></p>
<p>@unlock &lt;object&gt; Removes the @lock on an object or exit. This command is a synonym for @lock &lt;object&gt; .</p>
<a name="@update"></a>
<p><b>@update</b></p>
<p>@update &lt;object&gt; This command merely sets the Modification Time, seen when using the examine command, on an object to the current time, thus updating it without doing anything to the object itself.</p>
<a name="@upfront"></a>
<p><b>@upfront</b></p>
<p>@upfront &lt;object#&gt; This command, when used on an already destroyed object with the Going flag set, moves the specified object number up to the top of the free list. This means that the next time a person goes to @create , @dig , or @open an object, it will have the database reference number characteristic of the one on the top of the free list; most likely the one you've selected with the @upfront command.</p>
<a name="@wait"></a>
<p><b>@wait</b></p>
<p>@wait &lt;seconds&gt;=&lt;commands&gt; This command places a series of commands into the wait queue. The commands will not be executed until the number of &lt;seconds&gt; in real time have elapsed.</p>
<a name="@wipeattr"></a>
<p><b>@wipeattr</b></p>
<p>@wipe &lt;object&gt; @wipeattr &lt;object&gt;=&lt;attribute list&gt; This command removes all modifyable attribute values on a particular object. All user-defined attributes will remain, including those that are unsettable by yourself. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#008000">@wipeattr me</font>
<li><font color="#008000">@wipeattr here=desc ndesc</font>
</ul>
<a name="@zemit"></a>
<p><b>@zemit</b></p>
<p>@zemit &lt;zone object&gt;=&lt;message&gt; This command parses and sends a message to all of the objects located in each of the rooms that are linked to a particular &lt;zone object&gt;. You must own the zone to be able to send messages to its contents. This command may not be used on the Universal Zone Object, since it covers all rooms in the world and would use up quite a lot of processing time.</p>
<a name="@zone"></a>
<p><b>@zone</b></p>
<p>@zone &lt;object name&gt; This command creates a zone object with the specified name. Zone objects cannot be placed in any room, player, or thing, and must be accessed by database reference number.</p>

<p>Wizard Commands</p>
<a name="home"></a>
<p><b>home</b></p>
<p>home Powers: Build, Teleport This command sends the object who is executing it home. The home is the room that the object or player is linked to. Ordinary players may @link to the room they are in by using the save command.</p>
<a name="join"></a>
<p><b>join</b></p>
<p>join &lt;playername&gt; Powers: Join This command allows you to freely teleport to the room that another player, currently online the game, is in. It is quite useful for assisting other people with coding problems, or for merely helping new users to get acquainted with the game.</p>
<a name="slay"></a>
<p><b>slay</b></p>
<p>slay &lt;object&gt; slay &lt;object&gt;=&lt;cause&gt; Powers: Combat This command instantly kills an enemy or player. If it is a player, he or she will be sent to limbo just like as if being defeated by a regular enemy. If slaying any other type of object, no move will take place, but the object's @akill attribute will be triggered, with the cause as either you or &lt;cause&gt;, if specified.</p>

<p><b>Opaque</b></p>
<p>Opaque This flag may be set on a thing or player to hide the contents of that thing from normal view, only when a player uses the look command while not actually inside the object. It has no significance for rooms or exits.</p>
<a name="Player"></a>
<p><b>Player</b></p>
<p>Player A player character is one of five different types of objects, which can specifically be connected to on the game via an outside link to the real world. In brief, players act much like objects of type Thing , except that players may not enter other players, and that they own themselves.</p>
<a name="Puppet"></a>
<p><b>Puppet</b></p>
<p>Puppet This flag may be set on a room, thing, or exit. When set, the object relays all that it hears to its owner, with the name of the puppet object prefixed. The only current drawback to this is that the @ahear attribute and any !</p>
<a name="Quiet"></a>
<p><b>Quiet</b></p>
<p>Quiet When this flag is set on any type of object, all coding confirmation messages, such as 'Flag set', will be suppressed from the screen. This is mostly for objects who do a lot of triggering and are listening for key Events , or for players who have a slow connection and cannot take the amount of text that shows up on the screen while programming.</p>
<a name="Restricted"></a>
<p><b>Restricted</b></p>
<p>Restricted This flag, when set on a zone, places a portion of the game under special restrictions that gives players limited building abilities while operating within the parameters of the game. First, it only allows players to go through exits that have a return exit pointing back from the destination room. Second, players cannot @lock or @unlock exits in a Restricted zone.</p>
<a name="Room"></a>

<p><b>Slaved</b></p>
<p>Slaved This wizard flag may be set on a troublesome player in order to quiet him up, temporarily disabling all of the building and normal game commands available to the player except look , say , and move .</p>
<a name="Terse"></a>
<p><b>Terse</b></p>
<p>Terse This flag can be set on a player to suppress the descriptions on a room from view. Exits will be shown in aliased format to the right of the room name, and contents will be shown right below the room name. This is most useful if a player is trying to reach an area quickly, but has a slow connection and cannot take the amount of text that shows up on the screen.</p>
<a name="Thing"></a>
<p><b>Thing</b></p>
<p>Thing A thing is one of five different types of objects which make up the database. Any thing may be created using the @create command and can be placed inside any player, room, or another thing.</p>
<a name="Transparent"></a>
<p><b>Transparent</b></p>
<p>Transparent This wizard flag can be set on a thing to allow its contents to be visible during a normal look in the object's room. When inside the object, players may use normal exit directions to control the movement of the object.</p>
<a name="Universal"></a>
<p><b>Universal</b></p>
<p>Universal This flag may be set on a zone object to signify a universal background zone across all of the rooms in the database. Any ! or $ Events coded on this object will be available to any object online, as well as triggering the @aconnect or @adisconnect attributes each time a player logs on or off of the game.</p>
<a name="Unsaved"></a>
<p><b>Unsaved</b></p>
<p>Unsaved This flag can be set on normal things to specify that it is an object that cannot be saved in the database during reboots. Upon startup of the game, the object will automatically be destroyed.</p>
<a name="Verbose"></a>
<p><b>Verbose</b></p>
<p>Verbose This flag may be set on a room, thing, or exit. When set, the object relays all of the commands that it executes to its owner, with the name of the object prefixed.</p>
<a name="Visible"></a>
<p><b>Visible</b></p>
<p>Visible If this flag is set on a room, thing, exit, or player, different players, other than the owner of the object, will be able to examine the object, seeing all the code within and how everything works. Players set Visible can also have the status command used on them by different players successfully.</p>
<a name="Wall"></a>
<p><b>Wall</b></p>
<p>Wall If a room is set Wall , all magic spells within the room will be dissipated and non-functional. Magical equipment and magical items, such as Warp Boots or Wind Essence, will not work as well.</p>
<a name="Wander"></a>
<p><b>Wander</b></p>
<p>Wander This flag enables a thing to pick a random exit to move through every interval before an @atime attribute is triggered. This is more efficient to use than setting commands on @atime to move the object in a random direction.</p>
<a name="X-Zone"></a>
<p><b>X-Zone</b></p>
<p>X-Zone This wizard flag may be set on a room to designate a fourth-dimensional space in the world. All players and things within this room will not be able to see or talk to each other, yet all exits present will still be accessible.</p>
<a name="Zone"></a>
<p><b>Zone</b></p>
<p>Zone A zone is one of five different types of objects comprising the TinyMare database. A zone is linked to any number of rooms through the use of @addzone and @delzone , allowing its commands to be used by any player in those rooms. Once a room is linked to a zone, exits may not be made to and from rooms outside of the zone unless you are the zone's owner.</p>

<p>Section 6: Global Functions</p>
<a name="Functions"></a>
<p><b>Functions</b></p>
<p>Functions Functions provide the backbone to coding commands and objects on TinyMARE. They are used to call on-the-fly routines which take text arguments (input strings) and manipulate them to print its results within the the context of a command. In most commands, the brackets [] are required to tell TinyMARE that the text inside is indeed a function call and not to be represented literally.</p>

<a name="Macros"></a>
<p><b>Macros</b></p>
<p>Macros Along with the wide variety of commands that are available to the average player on the game, TinyMare also supports a quick set of one-symbol macros to allow easier gameplay and manipulation of your character. Each macro symbol is to be typed in as the first character in the line, with an additional message following that symbol.</p>
<a name="Zones"></a>
<p><b>Zones</b></p>
<p>Zones Zones comprise a small area of the world, usually composed of an average of 20-50 rooms. Sector names allow small parts of the world to be geographically defined, according to the land features or towns nearby. The link of a global zone is also important acting as the primary point for a particular sector.</p>
<a name="Section 8"></a>
<p><b>Section 8</b></p>
<p>Section 8: System Configuration Variables</p>
<a name="WIZLOCK_LEVEL"></a>
<p><b>WIZLOCK_LEVEL</b></p>
<p>WIZLOCK_LEVEL This variable controls the rank of players that are allowed to login to the game. The default setting, 0 , allows all ranks to connect. Setting a 1 allows only ranks 1 and above in and disallows normal player characters.</p>
<a name="GUEST_LOGIN"></a>
<p><b>GUEST_LOGIN</b></p>
<p>GUEST_LOGIN Controls whether players are allowed to create Guest accounts at the login prompt. A 1 means to turn on Guest creation, and 0 means to disable it. Guest logins are only acceptable when GUEST_PREFIX and GUEST_START are set appropriately.</p>
<a name="USER_LIMIT"></a>
<p><b>USER_LIMIT</b></p>
<p>USER_LIMIT This value puts a cap on the number of users that can connect to the game through the standard game ports (as defined in run/etc/ports ). Wizards can still connect on the admin ports beyond this limit.</p>
<a name="INACTIVENUKE"></a>
<p><b>INACTIVENUKE</b></p>
<p>INACTIVENUKE This value holds the number of days a player can refrain from logging into the game before being marked as Inactive . Every Saturday night, the game will automatically purge the database of inactive players that are not set Inactive_Ok . If this value is set to 0 , then no automatic purging will be done, and Wizards must use the @inactivity command to manually delete old players.</p>
<a name="ERR_SIGNAL"></a>
<p><b>ERR_SIGNAL</b></p>
<p>ERR_SIGNAL When set to 1 , the game will attempt to catch errors with the TinyMARE program, displaying a report to all players online as the problem is encountered. In the case of Infinite Loops or Segmentation Faults, TinyMARE will restart the game engine and reconnect users to the point where the game is playable again.</p>
<a name="LOG_FAILED_CMDS"></a>
<p><b>LOG_FAILED_CMDS</b></p>
<p>LOG_FAILED_CMDS When set to 1 , TinyMARE will log all failed commands executed by non-player objects to the logs/playerlog file on the local machine. A failed command is any such command that produces an &quot;Unrecognizable Command&quot; error or random typo message.</p>
<a name="HIDDEN_ADMIN"></a>
<p><b>HIDDEN_ADMIN</b></p>
<p>HIDDEN_ADMIN When set to 1 , all traces of rank distinction between players and administrators will be removed from players' sight. Specifically, @stats will not display the number of players in each rank level, +finger will not show the classname of a player, and the number of administrators logged in will not be shown on the who list. Also, any objects owned by a Wizard will have their Owner: field masked out when a normal player attempts to examine them.</p>
<a name="TIMEZONE"></a>
<p><b>TIMEZONE</b></p>
<p>TIMEZONE This value holds the base timezone offset of the machine that the game is running on, in number of hours + or - Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). For example, EST/EDT is -5, PST/PDT is -8, EET is +2, and JST is +9.</p>
<a name="HAVE_DST"></a>
<p><b>HAVE_DST</b></p>
<p>HAVE_DST This variable must be set to 1 if the system TinyMARE is running on changes the clock for Daylight Savings Time. This variable is required for players to get correct time readouts, and works in conjunction with the TIMEZONE configuration variable.</p>
<a name="DB_FORK"></a>
<p><b>DB_FORK</b></p>
<p>DB_FORK Set this variable to 1 if you would like TinyMARE to fork() its database saves into the background, allowing for the game to continue serving players while the save takes place. On most modern UNIX machines, this offers no performance decrease and is recommended to be turned on. Only for this case should DB_FORK be set to 0 .</p>
<a name="DB_LIMIT"></a>
<p><b>DB_LIMIT</b></p>
<p>DB_LIMIT Specifies the maximum number of objects that can be created in the database. When this number is reached, no new objects or players can be created until other objects are destroyed.</p>
<a name="DB_BACKUP"></a>
<p><b>DB_BACKUP</b></p>
<p>DB_BACKUP This variable determines the number of successive daily database backups that are kept in the db directory. Backups are automatically created on the first database save after midnight of each day, and the database file is appended with the current checkpoint number and compressed. This variable must be used in conjunction with DB_EPOCH , which determines the number of days between successive backups.</p>
<a name="DB_EPOCH"></a>
<p><b>DB_EPOCH</b></p>
<p>DB_EPOCH This value determines the number of days between successive backups when the DB_BACKUP variable is set to 1 or greater. Setting DB_EPOCH to a number less than 1 will still allow backups to take place once per day.</p>
<a name="RESTRICT_BUILD"></a>
<p><b>RESTRICT_BUILD</b></p>
<p>RESTRICT_BUILD Setting this variable to 1 restricts normal players from building on the game. Specifically, this prohibits the use of @create , @dig , @open , @link , @zone , @clone , and @chown . A player must be set with the Builder flag by a Wizard, or have the Build power, in order to build when the restriction is in effect.</p>
<a name="RESTRICT_TELEPORT"></a>
<p><b>RESTRICT_TELEPORT</b></p>
<p>RESTRICT_TELEPORT Setting this variable to 1 forces a number of restrictions on the game. It is used most when administrators want to limit a players' ability to move around anywhere or bypass certain areas. Wizards can choose which zones have the Restricted flag, thereby assigning areas where players can have free reign over teleportation commands, but only within the zone in question.</p>
<a name="RESTRICT_HASPOW"></a>
<p><b>RESTRICT_HASPOW</b></p>
<p>RESTRICT_HASPOW Setting this variable to 1 restricts the use of the powers() , controls() , and haspow() functions, such that players without the Examine power will not be able to use them to find out what powers administrators have.</p>
<a name="RESTRICT_HIDDEN"></a>
<p><b>RESTRICT_HIDDEN</b></p>
<p>RESTRICT_HIDDEN Setting this variable to 1 prohibits players from changing their @hlock to hide themselves from the who list. With this restriction enabled, the who list will not display the number of hidden players on the game, thus giving an added layer of security for players who have been explicitly set hidden by an administrator. Administrators must have the Wizattr power to both set and remove a player's @hlock when RESTRICT_HIDDEN is in effect.</p>

<p><b>EMAIL_COST</b></p>
<p>EMAIL_COST The amount of money charged for sending a +mail message to an address external to TinyMARE, such as an alternate MARE or to an internet email address. Because of the overhead involved, the charge is not refunded even if the remote address is unknown or does not exist.</p>
<a name="QUEUE_COST"></a>
<p><b>QUEUE_COST</b></p>
<p>QUEUE_COST This value represents the charge of 1/QUEUE_COST coins for each command that is queued by an object, as opposed to running it interactively. For example, if this value is the default 16 , then an object has a 1 in 16 chance of being charged 1 coin per queued command. One cannot queue commands when there is no money remaining.</p>
<a name="LINK_OK_COST"></a>
<p><b>LINK_OK_COST</b></p>

<a name="MAX_OUTPUT"></a>
<p><b>MAX_OUTPUT</b></p>
<p>MAX_OUTPUT This is the maximum number of characters of output a player can accumulate in a single time-frame. A time-frame describes when the game runs all queued commands, reads input from all players connected, and sends output to all connections.</p>
<a name="QUEUE_QUOTA"></a>
<p><b>QUEUE_QUOTA</b></p>
<p>QUEUE_QUOTA The total number of commands that an object can have in the queue at a single time. When an object reaches this limit, the object is set Haven and the message &quot;Run away object&quot; is sent to the object's owner. This has no effect if the owner of the object has the Queue power.</p>
<a name="MAX_PLAYER_WAIT"></a>
<p><b>MAX_PLAYER_WAIT</b></p>
<p>MAX_PLAYER_WAIT The maximum number of @wait commands that can be in the queue before an additional @wait issued by a player is refused. For security reasons, this value should be set to half that of MAX_WIZARD_WAIT , which has the same meaning but for Wizards instead of players.</p>
<a name="MAX_WIZARD_WAIT"></a>
<p><b>MAX_WIZARD_WAIT</b></p>
<p>MAX_WIZARD_WAIT The maximum number of @wait commands that can be in the queue before an additional @wait issued by a Wizard is refused. This variable is separate from MAX_PLAYER_WAIT and should be set higher such that players cannot flood the @wait queue to break code set on Wizard objects.</p>
<a name="FUNC_RECURSION"></a>
<p><b>FUNC_RECURSION</b></p>
<p>FUNC_RECURSION This directive sets the maximum number of nested function calls that can be executed before the function call is aborted and the string &quot;#-1 Too many levels of recursion.&quot; is returned. Normally this is not a problem, but functions such as s_as() can otherwise be used to cause infinite recursion.</p>
<a name="MAX_FUNCTIONS"></a>
<p><b>MAX_FUNCTIONS</b></p>
<p>MAX_FUNCTIONS This value represents the total number of functions that can be executed by the parser for a single command, excluding percent-substitutions.

<a name="ATIME_INTERVAL"></a>
<p><b>ATIME_INTERVAL</b></p>
<p>ATIME_INTERVAL Specifies the interval of time in seconds of how often the game will trigger the @atime attribute on a single object. When TinyMare is turned on, a loop counter is initialized at object #0. The game will only process a set number of objects per second based on the total database size.</p>
<a name="TIMEOUT_LOGIN"></a>
<p><b>TIMEOUT_LOGIN</b></p>
<p>TIMEOUT_LOGIN Specifies the number of seconds a player can remain idle at the login screen between typing two commands. Idle checks are made once per minute, and the game will instantly disconnect the player if idle for longer than this amount.</p>
<a name="TIMEOUT_SESSION"></a>

<a name="TECH_EMAIL"></a>
<p><b>TECH_EMAIL</b></p>
<p>TECH_EMAIL This value stores the email address of the maintainer of the site. It should be set to a contact address that players can refer to when they forget their passwords, have trouble connecting, or have problems with other players online.</p>
<a name="MAILHOST"></a>
<p><b>MAILHOST</b></p>
<p>MAILHOST This value is set to the remote hostname or IP address that TinyMARE uses to send outgoing email. If this value is blank, then the default server &quot;localhost&quot; will be assumed.

<p>PLAYER_START This variable holds the database room number where all new player characters will be created. This is also the default room for players to enter when one's current location is being destroyed. If a player's home is destroyed, it will automatically be relinked to this room.</p>
<a name="GUEST_START"></a>
<p><b>GUEST_START</b></p>
<p>GUEST_START This variable contains the database room number where all new Guests will enter the realm. It can be different from the PLAYER_START variable, which contains the location for normal player character creations. This value can only be set to a room dbref#.</p>
<a name="GAME_DRIVER"></a>
<p><b>GAME_DRIVER</b></p>
<p>GAME_DRIVER The Game Driver is a designated object that executes internal Mare commands requiring Wizard privileges. Commands that are too difficult to handle internally are placed into the command queue for automatic or delayed (via @wait ) processing by the Game Driver. For example, the Combat System uses the Game Driver to trigger actions on spells, whose commands are not tied to any database object attribute.</p>
<a name="DUNGEON_CELL"></a>
<p><b>DUNGEON_CELL</b></p>
<p>DUNGEON_CELL This dbref# specifies the room to which players will be sent to when they are jailed using the @capture command. For the jail to work effectively, the room should have no unlocked exits and should be set X-Zone to keep players from performing normal game commands and talking on +com channels.</p>
<a name="GUEST_PREFIX"></a>
<p><b>GUEST_PREFIX</b></p>
<p>GUEST_PREFIX This variable contains a short name, such as &quot;Guest&quot; , that will be prefixed to each Guest character that is created. A Guest ID is appended to each guest name, starting from 1, for each consecutive player that connects as a Guest. A Guest's alias is taken from the first letter of the GUEST_PREFIX , appended with the Guest ID.</p>
<a name="START_BONUS"></a>
<p><b>START_BONUS</b></p>
<p>START_BONUS The amount of money that a new player is given at character creation. A player can use the money to talk to others, buy initial supplies, or save for for later quests.</p>
<a name="GUEST_BONUS"></a>
<p><b>GUEST_BONUS</b></p>
<p>GUEST_BONUS The amount of money that a Guest is given at character creation. This value is necessary if there are simple charges for PAGE_COST and COM_COST , otherwise Guests would not be able to use the page and +com commands to talk to other players. This value can be better judged by remembering that Guests cannot give money to other players, nor can players give money to Guests.</p>
<a name="ALLOWANCE"></a>
<p><b>ALLOWANCE</b></p>
<p>ALLOWANCE This is the amount of money players receive each day they connect to the game. Players do not automatically get their allowance if they stay connected longer than 1 day, and they must reconnect in order to get that day's paycheck.</p>
<a name="MONEY_SINGULAR"></a>
<p><b>MONEY_SINGULAR</b></p>
<p>MONEY_SINGULAR Specifies the string to use to describe the money of the realm when it is being referred to singularly. For example, &quot;You found a Penny!&quot; would be displayed if this value is set to &quot;Penny&quot; .</p>
<a name="MONEY_PLURAL"></a>
<p><b>MONEY_PLURAL</b></p>
<p>MONEY_PLURAL Specifies the string to use to describe the money of the realm when it is being referred to plurally. For example, the phrase &quot;You have &lt;number&gt; Pennies.&quot; would be shown in a player's inventory if this value is set to &quot;Pennies&quot; (as long as &lt;number&gt; is not 1).</p>
<a name="Section 9"></a>
<p><b>Section 9</b></p>
<p>Section 9: Spell Attributes</p>
<a name="Spell Attributes"></a>
<p><b>Spell Attributes</b></p>
<p>Spell Attributes Numerical values: Text values:</p>
<a name="$type"></a>
<p><b>$type</b></p>
<p>$type This attribute designates the type of spell, item, technique, or equipment. It can be set to one of the values found in @list types . Values from 0 to 63 denote equipment that can be wielded or worn, values from 64 to 79 denote different types of items, and values from 80 and up deal with techniques, spells, and items that work with magic.</p>
<a name="$color"></a>
<p><b>$color</b></p>
<p>$color A numerical value representing the color of an item. This $color is more limited than that of the @color attribute, in that items can only be set with a foreground and background color, with the optional ability for rainbow.</p>
<a name="$value"></a>
<p><b>$value</b></p>
<p>$value This value represents the full price of an item as it would be displayed on a shop menu. Shops will buy items back for half of this amount, or varied depending on a player's skill at bargaining.</p>
<a name="$weight"></a>
<p><b>$weight</b></p>
<p>$weight This attribute determines the weight of an item in grams. Each player has a limit to the number of items he or she can carry determined by the weight of each item. This value is equivalent to the @weight attribute that can be set on an object.</p>
<a name="$material"></a>
<p><b>$material</b></p>
<p>$material This attribute is defined for equipment that can be worn. It describes the type of material the equipment is made out of, and judges an equipment's hardness, density, and resilience during physical attacks. Different types of materials can have interesting special properties.</p>
<a name="$flags"></a>
<p><b>$flags</b></p>
<p>$flags This attribute holds special flags that change the behavior of an item. An item's flags are a space-separated list of words from the table below that enable special features. All flags are specific to a group of item types, and some item types may not reflect the actions of a flag.</p>
<a name="$level"></a>
<p><b>$level</b></p>
<p>$level Items, when held in a player's inventory, do not have the Level setting that all Spells and Skills do. This attribute sets the default level of a technique when used as an item rather than casted as a spell.</p>
<a name="$cost"></a>
<p><b>$cost</b></p>
<p>$cost This attribute determines the Magic Power or Endurance point cost of casting the spell or executing the technique. Magic Power is only used when the $type of the spell is set to Magic , and Endurance is used when the type is set to Special . A technique can not be used unless the $cost requirement is fulfilled.</p>
<a name="$chantrate"></a>
<p><b>$chantrate</b></p>
<p>$chantrate This attribute determines the duration of time, in 1/10ths of a second, that it takes to cast a spell or execute a technique. For example, if this value was set to 45, then it would take 4.5 seconds before the spell began. This value only has meaning when the $type is set to Magic or Special .</p>
<a name="$areaatk"></a>
<p><b>$areaatk</b></p>
<p>$areaatk Specifies the area attack range of a spell or skilled technique. The range determines who and how many targets can get hit with the blast of a single attack. A spell's $areaatk is one of 8 different types, plus an optional set of one or more space-separated flags that modify the range of effect.</p>

Therefore the lock cannot be based on the target or arguments of the spell. $lock can be used to restrict the spell to certain areas or sector types, but not to specific groups of enemies (which can be accomplished in more detail on the event-level of control). $lock has the same semantics as the object attribute @lock , with %# equal to the player# using the item and %! set to the Game Driver with privileges to operate the lock.</p>
<a name="$ufail"></a>
<p><b>$ufail</b></p>
<p>$ufail This attribute contains the message that is to be displayed to the player when he or she fails the $lock on an item while typing use or cast . If not set, the default phrase &quot;You can't use %0 here.&quot; is displayed.</p>

<a name="$succ"></a>
<p><b>$succ</b></p>

<a name="$fail"></a>
<p><b>$fail</b></p>
<p>$fail This message is displayed to the caster when the technique misses its intended target. It replaces the default &quot;Miss&quot; message that the event would have normally printed on the screen.</p>
<a name="$ofail"></a>
<p><b>$ofail</b></p>
<p>$ofail This attribute holds the message everyone in the room except the caster and the target would see when a technique misses its inteded target. It is displayed in place of the default &quot;Miss&quot; message that the event would have normally printed on the screen.</p>
<a name="$tfail"></a>
<p><b>$tfail</b></p>
<p>$tfail This attribute holds the message that the target of the technique would see in the case of a miss. It is displayed in place of the default &quot;Miss&quot; message that the event would have normally printed on the screen.</p>
<a name="$fumble"></a>
<p><b>$fumble</b></p>
<p>$fumble This message is displayed to the caster when he or she fumbles his attack onto an unsuspecting victim. It is in effect the same as a success message, except the target (%#) may or may not be different (a fumble can occur on the intended target, only a different message may be printed).</p>

When both $drop and $odrop are set on an item, and the item's $flags contain the Fragile option, the phrase &quot;%0 shatters on the floor!&quot; will be suppressed. This message need not be set for a Fragile item if the @eventkey on the room is expecting someone to drop that item in a specific location.</p>
<a name="$odrop"></a>
<p><b>$odrop</b></p>
<p>$odrop This message will be displayed to everyone else in the room a player drops this item from his or her inventory to the floor. See $drop for details and pronoun usage.</p>
