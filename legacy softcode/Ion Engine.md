```mush
Disengage:	$disengage ion:@swi [get(s(%/Helm//Engine))]=[num(me)],{@EngEff me=get(s(%/Us//Efficiency));@efficiency %/Us/;@engine %/Helm/;@thrust %/Us/;@wait 1=@pemit %#=Ion Drive Disengaged.;@tr [get(me/helm)]/emote=eng,Engineering: Ion Drive disengaged.},{@pemit %#=That engine is not currently engaged.}
Desc:	The thrust of this engine is generated by releasing electrically charged particles called ion's. The result is a low-thrust and easily managable rate of acceleration or deacceleration.
Min:	100000
Fail:	What?! Are you kidding? This thing weighs tons!
Engage:	$engage ion:@swi truth(get(s(%/Us//Efficiency)))=1,{@pemit %#=[name(get(s(%/Helm//Engine)))] is currently engaged, disengage it first.},{@Efficiency %/Us/=%/EngEff/;@Rating %/Us/=%/EngRat/;@Engine %/Helm/=num(me);@MinThr %/Helm/=%/Min/;@MaxThr %/Helm/=%/Max/;@wait 1=@pemit %#=Ion Drive engaged;@tr [get(me/helm)]/emote=eng,Engineering: Ion Drive engaged.}
