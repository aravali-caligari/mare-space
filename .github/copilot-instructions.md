# Language Parsing guideline for the markdown code blocks

- The language blocks labeled as "mud" contain legacy softcode code snippets.
- This softcode is used for a server-side game engine that has a Space Simultation embedded within it.
- The softcode syntax includes commands, attributes, and object definitions specific to the game engine.
- When parsing or analyzing these code blocks, treat them as legacy softcode and apply relevant parsing rules for MARE/MUSE/MUSH softcode.
- The markdown section named 'Attribute Definitions' contains the definitions of attributes used in the softcode.
  - Each attribute in the 'definitions' section is defined with its name followed by a colon a list of attribute types.
- The markdown section named 'Attribute list' contains the actual attribute values for the object.
  - Each attribute in the 'list' section is defined with its name followed by a colon and its corresponding value.
  - Values may include commands, text, or references to other objects or attributes.
  - Any value starting with a dollar sign ($) indicates a command or program to be executed by its name that a player can invoke.
  - The $ values can contain wildcards and patterned matched until the next : character.
  - Anything that looks like ':/[get(me/Eng)]/ is referring to a 'locking' test to see if a player can activate that command. Any locking that that fails will prevent the command from being executed.
  - The @ symbol is used to denote specific commands or actions within the softcode.
  - Anything inside brackets [] is a substituition section that will be replaced by the results of the inside function.
  - Anything that looks like 'v(0)' is referring to a variable that is being passed into the command or function. Anything that looks like '%1' is also referring to a variable that is being passed into the command or function.
  - Anything that looks like 'get(me/Eng_Man)' is referring to getting the attribute of an object, in this case the object that is running the command (me), and its attribute name.
  - Semicolons (;) are used to separate multiple commands or actions within a single attribute value.
  - Many '@commands' are native commands of the MARE/MUSE/MUSH softcode language, such as @pemit, @wait, @swi, and @force.
  - Braces '{}' are used to group commands or actions together and typically used as part of a conditional statement like '@swi' (i.e. switch).
  - Some function names and command '@' names are referr
  ing to custom functions or attributes definted elsewhere in the softcode.
  - The 'get(me/us)' is referring to getting the attribute 'us' of the object running the command (me). 'us' is an attribute that refers to the Space Ship object that the console is part of.
  - An example like '@pwrgen [get(me/us)]=sub(get(s([get(me/us)]/pwrgen)),abs(%1))' means this: Get the absolute value of the first variable passed into the command (%1), then subtract that from the current power generation value of the Space ship object related to the console running the command (me/us), and set that as the new power generation value of the space ship object part of the console running the command (me/us).
  - A switch statement (@swi) is similar to an if-else statement, where it checks a condition and executes different commands based on whether the condition is true or false. This example: @swi get(me/PwrBatt)=*Damaged*,{@pemit %0=Batteries are damaged.},*Destroyed*,{@pemit %0=Batteries are destroyed.},{@swi %[comp(sub(get(me/MaxBatt),1),add(get(me/PwrBatt),abs(%1)))%]=-1,{@pemit %0=Batteries cannot be charged to that potential.},{@pwrbatt me=add(get(me/pwrbatt),abs(%1));@pwrgen [get(me/us)]=sub(get(s([get(me/us)]/pwrgen)),abs(%1));@pemit %0=Power Allocated to Batteries.} means this: Check the power battery status of the console (me). If it has the wildcarded keyword of 'Damaged', emit a message to the player (@pemit) saying "Batteries are damaged.". Otherwise, check if adding the absolute value of the first variable passed into the command (%1) to the current power battery value would exceed the maximum battery capacity minus 1. If it would exceed, emit a message saying "Batteries cannot be charged to that potential." Otherwise, increase the power battery value by the absolute value of %1, decrease the power generation of the related space ship object (me/us) by the same amount, and emit a message saying "Power Allocated to Batteries." 
  - When parsing or analyzing these code blocks, consider the context of a space simulation game and the specific functionalities provided by the softcode commands and attributes.
  - Any function may be a native function or a custom function defined on an attribute with the attribute flag: 'function' and will have an attribute list name like: evalfuel()
  - The 'program' attribute flag indicates that the attribute is a program that can be invoked by players or other objects.
  - The 'inherit program' flag indicates that the attribute is inheriting a program from a parent object or prototype.
  - Any command that starts with '!' sign is a space sim specific command and not a native MARE/MUSE/MUSH command.
  - The 'me' keyword refers to the object that is executing the command.
  - The 'us' keyword refers to the space ship object that the console is part of.
  - The @wait command is used to introduce a delay before executing the next command.
  - Any function that starts with 'f' such as fadd(), fsub(), fmul(), fdiv(), fsqrt() are floating point math functions.
  - Any function or command that references #-1 is a return value indicating an error or invalid state.
  - Any function or command that returns a positive value # is a valid object reference.
  - Anything named %R is a carriage return character.
  - The 'spc(1)' function returns a single space character.
  - The 'pi()' function returns the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).
  - The 'first()', 'rest()', and 'mid()' functions are used for string manipulation, extracting specific parts of a string based on position.
  - Anything function that looks like a color name (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta, White, Black) is returning the corresponding ANSI color code for that color.
  - The attributes named 'LinPosX', 'LinPosY', 'LinPosZ', 'LinVelX', 'LinVelY', 'LinVelZ' are referring to the linear position and linear velocity coordinates of a Space ship object in 3D space.
  - The 'velmag()' function calculates the magnitude of a velocity vector given its components.
  - The 'relphi()' function calculates the relative angle between two objects based on their position and velocity components.
  - The '@tr' command is used to trigger another attribute or program on the object referrenced (example: @tr me/doneturn means to trigger the 'doneturn' attribute on the current object (me)).
  - The '@foreach' command is used to iterate over a list of objects or values, executing a block of code for each item in the list.
  - The attributes named 'angaccx/y/z' are referring to the angular acceleration of a Space ship object around its X, Y, and Z axes.
  - The space-sim function that looks like 'dg2rd()' is converting degrees to radians.
  - Any string of text that is not bracketed and not '$' and not '!' and not starting with '@' is treated as literal text to be emitted or displayed to the player.
  - Any command named '@fo' or '@force' is a force command that forces the execution of the following commands regardless of locking or conditions.
  - Any section beginning with an attribute named followed by a :/[locking test]/$command: is followed by multiple lines with a new MARE syntax with more traditional modern indentation and line breaks for readability.
  - The file named 'legacy_MARE_helptext.html' contains additional help text and documentation about the legacy MARE softcode commands and functions.

- The goal of the above guidelines is to ensure accurate parsing and understanding of the legacy softcode within the markdown files, enabling effective analysis, modification, or execution of the code in the context of the MARE/MUSE/MUSH game engine. 
- Most lines of attribute list will be very long and contain multiple commands separated by semicolons. Most lines are legacy 'MARE/MUSE/MUSH' code and are being converted to a new MARE2 code style with more traditional indentation and line breaks for readability.
- Another goal is to convert the legacy softcode into a more modern MARE2 code style with improved readability while preserving the original functionality and logic of the code.
- The terminalogy listed below are usually space-related terms: OMS = Orbital Maneuvering System, RCS = Reaction Control System, TAC = Tactical Console, Sci = Science Console, Nav = Navigation Console, Eng = Engineering Console, Pwr = Power, Batt = Battery, Pwrgen = Power Generation, Linpos = Linear Position, Linvel = Linear Velocity, Angacc = Angular Acceleration, Velmag = Velocity Magnitude, Relphi = Relative Angle, Dg2rd = Degrees to Radians.
- The chat questions about these code blocks should focus on understanding, analyzing, or modifying the legacy softcode within the context of the MARE/MUSE/MUSH game engine and space simulation functionalities.
- The syntax described in the file 'TinyMARE II help documentation.md' refers to new MARE2 softcode syntax and is the desired syntax of the converted legacy softcode.
- When converting the legacy softcode to the new MARE2 code style, ensure that the indentation and line breaks are applied consistently to enhance readability while maintaining the original logic and functionality of the code.
- The converted softcode also refers to legacy space-sim functions and commands that should be converted to equivilant MARE2 space-sim functions and commands where applicable. The new Space-sim is commonly referred to as 'SpaceMARE'. The conversion instructions and hints for space-sim to the new MARE2 Space Sim is detailed in the file 'README.legacy.conversions.md'.
- The file ''README.softcode.manual.md' contains additional information about the softcode attributes and functions used in the new space simulation context.
- The folder named 'legacyspacesim' has the legacy C code that shows the function names and command names used by the softcode. Any C function named 'fun_xxx' is referring to a softcode function named 'xxx'. Any C function named 'cmd_xxx' is referring to a softcode command named '@xxx'.
- The C structures are usually showing the space ship object attributes and their names and data types.
- A chatprompt will be given that says 'analyze the attribute list code and provide an english description of what the code does' and the response should be a detailed english description of what the code is doing. Place the description in a markdown code block and reference the original attribute name.
- I will be modifying the english description to the actual logic description as I understand it. A chatprompt will be given that says 'convert the attribute list code using the english description as hints on how to convert to new MARE2 code style with improved readability' and the response should be the converted code with proper indentation and line breaks for readability while preserving the original functionality and logic of the code. Place the converted code in a markdown code block and reference the original attribute name.
