Desc:	The thrust of this engine is generated by releasing electrically charged particles called ion's. The result is a low-thrust and easily managable rate of acceleration or deacceleration.

EngRat:	1000
Desc:	This engine is a small fusion reactor about 20 feet high and 40 feet square. The thrust of this engine is generated by the continuous energy release of an atomic fusion reaction. The result is high-thrust forces, the effect is like riding an explosion. The have been known, on occasion, to backfire and explode with tremendous force. Being in this room while the engine is running can cause radiation poisoning, so a rad-suit is advised. This paticular drive was manufactured by Streel Corporation.
